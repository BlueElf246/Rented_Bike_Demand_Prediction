    "# Assignment: Exploratory Data Analysis with tidyverse and ggplot2\n",
    "Estimated time needed: 60 minutes\n",

    "\n",
    "# Introduction and Objectives\n",
    "In this Lab, you will use an R notebook to perform exploratory data analysis using tidyverse and the ggplot2 R packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will start by doing some minor data preparation on the SEOUL BIKE SHARING dataset. Then you will generate and explore some statistics from the resulting dataframe and make some observations. Finally, you will generate some informative plots using the ggplot2 library. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your primary objective is to gather insights from your exploratory analysis. These findings will be part of your story that you will create your final capstone presentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization is a very powerful tool for better understanding your data and finding patterns that may exist in it. You can use scatterplots, for example, to display how well two features are correlated with, or similar to each other.  When data are highly correlated, it means they vary in similar ways, and so their graphs will look similar (once scaled to a common scale). We can say one variable 'explains' the variation in the other, and that they are 'covariates'. There could be a causal relationship between covariates, meaning that changing one variable has the effect of changing the other, but this need not be the case. Perhaps there is another factor which causes both covariates to respond to variations, or the similarity could be a random coincidence. Either way, the behaviour of one variable can be used to predict the behaviour of the other. The key practical difference is that in the causal case, if we can influence the first variable then we can have a corresponding causal influence on the second. Like turning a light switch on or off to control the light in the room, the state of the switch controls the state of the light bulb. This is an important topic for data science that is beyond our current scope, but we invite you to delve deeper into the subject as you progress in your career$.^{1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Other ways visualization can inform your analysis is with spotting outliers and anomalous behaviour in your features. Boxplots are informative in these regards. You can also gain insights about any clear trends and anomalies that may be present in a variable, simply by plotting it directly. For instance, time series and spatial data are particularly interesting kinds of variables. Outliers can easily consume the range of your plot though, making your data look like a featureless flat line in comparison to these points. So some cleaning, namely outlier removal, may be required to get a clearer picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "A word of caution: be skeptical about any patterns you find, especially in smaller datasets. In very simple terms, it is true that any two points randomly placed in space always define a unique line; but add a third random point, and it is very unlikely that it will land on that same line. This suggests one of the main advantages of 'big data' - any patterns that emerge in very large datasets are far more likely to persist on unseen data than those found in small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "All right, let's move along and get started with our exploratory analysis!\n"
