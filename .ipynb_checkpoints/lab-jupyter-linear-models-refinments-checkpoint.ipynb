    "In addition to the methods mentioned in this lab and previous data analysis courses, you could also explore to try the following methods yourself to see if they could improve model performance:\n",
    " - Remove potential redundant variables. If two variables have extremly high correlated, it is possible that they are redundant and could be removed from the model to improve the performance.\n",
    " - Remove some outliers. Linear regression models are very sensitive to outliers, you could try to remove some outliers to see if it would improve performance\n",
    " - Apply logarithm transformation. In case variable distributions are not normal distribution such as log-normal distribution, you could apply logaritm transformation on the variable to make them more look like normal distribution. In addition, logarithm transformation helps capture the non-linear relationships.\n",

    "If you have time, you could research and try more methods by searching related research papers/articles, discussion forums, etc. If you know how to use other machine learning models with `Tidymodels` such as Neural Networks, Tree models, or Boosting models, you can also try and compare them with the linear regression models.\n"
